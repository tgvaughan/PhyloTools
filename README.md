PhyloPaint
==========

This program takes extended Newick specifications of phylogenetic
trees and networks and renders them in a variety of output formats via
the Cairo graphics library.  Unlike the majority of tree visualisers
available, this program works non-interactively.

The eventual aim is to provide something similar to GraphViz, but 
specifically aimed at rooted and timed phylogenies where one axis
is scaled to represent time.

This is a work in progress, although it can already be used to paint
readable trees and networks from Nexus files containing annotated
extended Newick trees---as produced by
[Hamlet](http://tgvaughan.github.com/Hamlet).
